# Zookeepr-Express.js

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a website to create and store tasks. The site allows the user to create a task with a name and due date. The tasks can also be sorted into the categories of 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Complete.' Users can edit and delete tasks as needed. Tasks are added to local storage so that data persists for the user.
